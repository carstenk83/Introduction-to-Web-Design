			<div class="about-text">
				<p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Whiplash</span>, Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) faces relentless pressure and emotional abuse from his teacher, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). The film opens with Andrew practicing alone, when Fletcher watches from the shadows, demanding perfection. When Andrew makes a mistake, Fletcher insults him with harsh remarks like, “Your version of an answer was to turn into a wind-up monkey.” <br><br>Fletcher’s abusive tactics—both physical and psychological—are meant to push Andrew past his limits. On his first day in the Studio Band, Andrew is slapped across the face for not keeping tempo. Fletcher’s cruel insults continue, questioning Andrew’s musical ability and pushing him to the edge. This toxic mentorship drives Andrew to sacrifice his health and well-being in pursuit of perfection, illustrating the extreme cost of ambition in <span style="font-style: italic;">Whiplash</span>.</p>
