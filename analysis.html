                <h3>Power and Control</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-item">
                <p>Fletcher uses intimidation and manipulation to maintain control over his students. His constant monitoring and harsh criticism break them down, forcing them to comply with his vision of greatness. The more submissive his students become, the more power Fletcher gains in shaping their future success or failure.</p>

                <h3>Internalized Pressure</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-item">
                <p>Neiman internalizes Fletcher’s abusive tactics, pushing himself beyond his physical and mental limits in pursuit of validation and success. He sacrifices his health, relationships, and sense of self-worth, believing that only through pain can he achieve his dreams of greatness.</p>

                <h3>Foucault’s Panopticism</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-item">
                <p>Fletcher embodies the concept of Panopticism, a theory proposed by philosopher Michel Foucault. Foucault believed in a prison where there was a central tower, prisoners would feel the need to self-regulate their actions due to the possibility of someone watching their actions. Neiman constantly feels like he is being watched, internalizing Fletcher’s demands to the point where he self-regulates, even when his mentor is not physically present.</p>
